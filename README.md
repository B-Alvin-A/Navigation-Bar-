# Navigation-Bar-
This is a HTML and CSS code for a navigation bar with five items: Home, Foods, Clothes, Medicine, and Cart.

It consists of an unordered list (ul) containing five list items (li), each with an anchor (a) element that contains an icon and a title.

When a list item is hovered over, the border color of the item changes to a custom color defined using CSS variables. When a list item is clicked, it becomes active, and a circular highlight element appears behind it with a color matching the border color. The active item also moves upward, and its title becomes visible.

The styling is done using CSS, and some additional icons are added using the Ionicons library. The container element is centered on the page using flexbox.
